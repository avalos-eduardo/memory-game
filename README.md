## What I Practiced While Coding This Project
- useEffect Hook
  - For this project I learned how to use the useEffect hook and utilized it to asynchronously connect to the pokeAPI.
  - It was configured so that the pokemon's names and images would be fetched from the pokeAPI upon App.jsx's inital render.
 
- Async/Await
  - In this project I had the chance to practice my asynchronous programming skills and used JS Promises to ensure that all of the pokemon's data were successfully retrieved before beginning the rendering process.
  - If any of the data was unsuccessfully retrieved then the website would catch it and return an error to the console.
 
- Responsive CSS
  -  For this project I used CSS grid to neatly display the pokemon card components and allow for easy responsive views for smaller screen sizes.
  -  Using media queries, I set breakpoints at certain screen widths where text would be made smaller and the grid columns/rows would be set to take up less screen space.
